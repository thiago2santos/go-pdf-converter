## Development Setup

### Prerequisites

```bash
# Install Go 1.21 or later
go version

# Install Tesseract OCR
# macOS
brew install tesseract

# Ubuntu/Debian
sudo apt-get install tesseract-ocr libtesseract-dev

# Fedora/RHEL
sudo dnf install tesseract tesseract-devel
```

### Building from Source

```bash
# Clone your fork
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/go-pdf-converter.git
cd go-pdf-converter

# Install dependencies
go mod download

# Install git hooks (recommended)
make install-hooks

# Build
make build

# Run tests

```

### Git Hooks

We use pre-commit hooks to ensure code quality. The hooks will:
- Check code formatting with `gofmt`
- Run `golangci-lint` before each commit

**Install hooks:**
```bash
make install-hooks
```

**Skip hooks (when needed):**
```bash
git commit --no-verify
```
